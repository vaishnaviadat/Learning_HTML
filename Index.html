    <h1>Novel History</h1><hr>
    <p>A novel is an extended work of narrative fiction usually written in prose and <b>published as a book.</b>The word derives from the <strong>Italian: </strong> novella for 'new', 'news', or 'short story (of something new)', itself from the Latin: novella, a singular noun use of the neuter plural of novellus, diminutive of novus, meaning 'new'. According to <i>Margaret Doody</i> , the novel has <em>"a continuous and comprehensive history of about two thousand years"</em> , with its origins in the Ancient Greek and Roman novel, Medieval chivalric romance, and the tradition of the Italian Renaissance novella. The ancient romance form was revived by Romanticism, in the historical romances of Walter Scott and the Gothic novel. Some novelists, including <u>Nathaniel Hawthorne</u> , <mark>Herman Melville, Ann Radcliffe, and John Cowper Powys</mark> , preferred the term romance. Such romances should not be confused with the genre fiction romance novel, which focuses on romantic love. M. H. Abrams and Walter Scott have argued that a novel is a fiction narrative that displays a realistic depiction of the state of a society, like Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird. The romance, on the other hand, encompasses any fictitious narrative that emphasizes marvellous or uncommon incidents. In reality, such works are nevertheless also commonly called novels, including Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and J. R. R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings.</p>
